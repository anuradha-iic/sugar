Colo:
$50 p/100Kbps will be charged for bandwidth over the committed rate using the 95th percentile billing method.  
Regarding power planning, utilization of an automatic transfer switch (ATS) is strongly recommended if *ANY* single power supply equipment will be installed.  An ATS allows single power supply equipment to be fed by the two separate electrical systems that supply an N+1 circuit.  Also note that maximum sustained usage on any one circuit is 80% of stated amperage capacity.  For example, 16 Amps is the max draw allowed on an N+1 20A 120V Conditioned AC Power Circuit.


Shared Internet T1:
Pricing based on 1 static IP address.  
Customer will supply cabling from their suite to MPOE if required (NextLevel can provide recommended vendor).
Customer will supply internal router/switch/firewall (e.g., Linksys E1000).  
NextLevel Internet is not responsible for any firewall protection or VLAN switch segmenting.  
Bandwidth utilization monitored for excessive use of shared connection.  In case of continued excessive usage, bandwidth burstability may be throttled.
