I just wanted to get back to you regarding our phone conversation.

NextLevel Internet Voice and Data services moving forward: 

•	5 SIP trunk lines @ $10/each: $50/month
•	1 Hunt group @ $10/each: $10/month
•	2,000 minute bucket at $.04/min = $80/month
•	T1 circuit = $395/month
•	All install fees waived 
•	On premise equipment supplied by NextLevel Internet
•	We will uphold your existing Master Service Agreement terms.

Total voice and data would be $535/month (no taxes on data. There is approximately 12% tax on voice services).

Early Termination for T1 circuit: 

•	Contract ends on 11/1/2010.
•	Agreement calls for 100% of fees until the end of the contract, but I estimate that we can do it for 60% of the agreement.
•	100% of the agreement would be $3,325.
•	60% of the agreement would be $ 1,995. Again this is an estimate.

Let me know if this works for you and I will put together a simple change form for your approval.","Closed Lost","535.00","0","0.00","5/31/2010","Existing Client","Follow up","Client Upgrade","1","0","Omitted","Jerry Morris","Senior Account Manager","3/5/2010","Jeff Posner","3/13/2012","Al Allen","4/19/2010","2010","Q2-2010","87.0000000000","","","","","","1 Year","","","","","","","","","","","","","0.00","0.00"

Special Comments:

On 6/1/11 the Illinois office and all other voice services active in the domain will begin billing at a flat $.040625 per minute rate (based on actual usage) until the until HQ has finished implementation or until the minimum monthly commitment of $4,875 is achieved. NextLevel would charge .040625 per minute on a 120,000 minute commitment, with .025 per minute on overages that exceed 120,000 minutes. Upon project completion and sign off, the collective DS3 and fail over T1 price reductions will take place.  This time stamp will also mark the beginning  of the new voice and data services term. This is expected to occur some time in July, 2011.  Clones can be used in the soft phone environment or in call center or hunting environments. 

If any of the Extension or Attendant totals are exceeded, the following would be the per increment rates to expand the system for the  locations:
Enhanced Extensions list = $30 each, Peregrine Rate = $5 per month
Standard Extensions list = $20 each, Peregrine Rate = $5 per month
Clone Extensions list = $5 each, Peregrine Rate = $5 per month
Auto Attendants list = $25 each, Peregrine Rate = $5 per month
DID/DOD over 300 numbers = $1.50 per month each
Unlimited MYNLVFax list is $25 each, 
Peregrine would be required to purchase any new handsets (Cisco, AC Adaptor required and not POE), ATA’s (analog Conference room phones or Bogen device for PA’s), and other phone specific items. NextLevel would supply 10/100 switches, firewalls and routers to accommodate the servicing of the phone system (If necessary). That equipment would be selected and serviced by NextLevel (if applicable).","","","","","","7665.00","0.00"

BTW…Our current DS3 rate is $1,354 + taxes + $150 per month x-con fee at Level3 = $1,550 per month +/- and is on TWTC, which I want to get off of in with their expensive DS3’s.

Subject:	Please check voicemail Amber at Access Nurses
Alan Braynin the owner asked her (Amber) to call.  Access Nurses has been a client for about 9 years and were originally a PS bus park client, but then they got big.
Arnon Bruener is the IT guy (South American and likes us)…they either have Cox or TWTC for voice.  They signed up last year, so not sure if they are having problems with Cox or TWTC.  They defintately don’t have a phone system that can support their remote staff.
They use our T1 for their VoIP to South America for a call center.
Access Nurses is a pretty large organization.  Our hosted voice solution could be extremely effective with their traveling nursing staff.  Also our cloud services could be great for their scheduling platform.
The pricing they had was good.  We can be aggressive.
-Good luck.  This could be a very good existing client upgrade or save at the minimum.
Let me know if you need help.

Hey Joe,

We spoke a while back regarding the  phones that were drop-shipped to our office. Last time we spoke, you mentioned your upcoming move and one great things about our phone system is that moves are as simple as unplugging the phone at one location and plugging it in at a new location. As long as you have a good internet connection, the phone system will work and there is no cost association with moving a phone. It will ring to that office number regardless of location. In fact, I occasionally bring my phone home and plug it in there. When someone calls in, they have no idea that I am at home. 

Thus, we just need to put the service contract in place and you will be up and running and we can have the phones set up at your temporary or permanent location(s). If a move comes, you just unplug the phones and plug them in to the internet connection at your new location.

Let me know how you want to proceed.
6/18-LM per his request on f/u date. See e-mails.
7/7-Spoke to Joe and the 5 people that were to be using these might be moving offices in the next month or so (possibly as long as a year). He was hoping we could ship the phones up to him at the Orangethorpe location.

My thought after I got off the phone is that it doesn't matter if they move and the phones are activated, they can just p[lug them in the new location.","Closed Lost","125.00","0","0.00","8/31/2009","","","Client Upgrade","1","0","Omitted","Al Allen","Account Manager","6/11/2009","Al Allen","9/9/2009","Al Allen","","2009","Q3-2009","81.0000000000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0.00","0.00"

Possible Upgrade. Competing with Telepacific.

Integrated Voice offering:
This is the least cost alternative that will allow you to:
· Continue to use your existing phone system.
· Keep your costs down.
· Keep the great Internet service from NextLevel that is shared in the building.
· Seamlessly switch over to the hosted voice system in the future to include more features than the existing system can support (such as work from home).
NextLevel would keep the existing Internet connection and add five digital voice trunks.
Pricing:
Existing Data T1 line: Reduced to $420/month (taxes are included, this would be equivalent to a $375 price from other competitors and our link is completely managed)
5 Digital Voice Trunks at $10/Trunk: $50/month
2,000 anywhere in USA minutes: $90/month
Total monthly cost would be $560/month
This option would save you over $400/month from your existing voice and data scenario. If you decide to move forward with the voice and data option, we would change the price and term of the T1 upon signature of the documents.
Taxes are included on the internet portion of this service, but taxes do apply on the voice portion.
Installation:
All installation fees are waived and NextLevel would supply the necessary equipment to implement the SIP trunks.
Term:
3 month revolving term with a 45 day advanced notification to cancel services.
Internet only option:
You would just keep the Internet line.
Pricing:
$465/month (taxes are included, this would be equivalent to a $410 price from other suppliers)
Term:
3 month revolving term with a 45 day advanced notification to cancel services.
We can make this transition immediately and it is relatively simple. We will assign a NextLevel Internet dedicated project coordinator that will handle the details of the transition for you.
Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Additionally, let me know which of the above options you would like to pursue and I will send you a simple, 1 page Add form to return to us.","Closed Won","560.00","100","560.00","2/11/2010","","Follow up","","1","1","Closed","Jerry Morris","Senior Account Manager","2/8/2010","Jeff Posner","8/4/2010","Jeff Posner","3/22/2010","2010","Q1-2010","3.0000000000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0.00","0.00"

We met a few months ago and I followed up with the e-mail below. At that time, we discussed our hosted voice system that would allow you to save money and increase your voice features. I just wanted to check in to see how it is going on your end and see if there would be an opportunity, in the future, to show you our web-based phone user interface.

Would love to, but the prospect of securing a site & email host on short notice isn’t appealing (sorry).  Gonna stay with the status quo for now .
Hi Julie,

That sounds great. What about the T1 opportunity now? We would certainly like the opportunity to be your ISP. Just let me know.

Hi Al,

We’ve decided that we’re not ready to make any drastic changes in regards to our phone services at this time but would definitely like to entertain the idea next year.  I’m going to move your info into a resource folder for next June/July – ish.   Please feel free to call on us as early as next May so we can start the wheels turning.  Thank you for your recent efforts.

8/6-Spoke to Julie and went over pricing and voice (need to refer Mati to her when I speak to her next for web hosting and e-mail services). They had a bad experience with AT&T VoIP a few years ago, but I went over our voice with our internet and QoS policy prioritizing voice and that call only takes 20kbs. She was concerned about quality of voice and speed of data of they were running a larger report (common for them). They were waiting to hear back from current ISP. Follow up Monday if I haven’t heard from Julie.

Hi Vance,

The Toll Free (including the DID) is $10 per month and minutes are charged outside the minute bucket.  Low / no volume is .05 per minute Anywhere in the USA.  If your company is doing 10,000 +, the rate goes to .04 and 20,000 +, the rate goes to .035 per minute.  

Our SIP trunks can make inbound and outbound calls.  In the SIP world, similar to the cell phone world, all call directions (in and out) are billable.

A quote for a single trunk is as follows:

1 SIP trunk @ $10 each = $10 per month
$10 Install fee
Minute rate at .05 per minute

We make the assumption your IVR system can handle a SIP trunk naturally.  If not, let us know and I will tell you which type of ATA (digital to analog converter) to purchase.

Month to Month Term

Regarding power planning, utilization of an automatic transfer switch (ATS) is strongly recommended if *ANY* single power supply equipment will be installed.  An ATS allows single power supply equipment to be fed by the two separate electrical systems that supply an N+1 circuit.  Also note that maximum sustained usage on any one circuit is 80% of stated amperage capacity.  For example, 16 Amps is the max draw allowed on an N+1 20A 120V Conditioned AC Power Circuit.","","","","","","0.00","0.00"
